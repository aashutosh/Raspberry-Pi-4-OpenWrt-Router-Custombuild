# Why I made this Custom-build Raspberry Pi 4 OpenWRT Firmware

For years I have been looking for a home router solution which is decent hardware at a price that won't make you cry.  The majority of available home routers out there have such minimal hardware specs that they really aren't up to any task much more than just supplying internet to the house.   Too bad if you want to get decent NAS capability out of the device - in my experience that's usually a pretty frustratingly slow affair with your typical home router.  Then I spotted an interesting project website by a guy named Vladimír Záhradník.  Vladimir describes his Raspberry Pi 4 router project using OpenWRT as the software basis and his project site for that is [HERE](https://www.zahradnik.io/raspberry-pi-as-a-home-router "HERE").  So I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 and followed Vlad's guidance; it worked really well and I've now got a very capable Pi 4 OpenWRT router running at my house which is vastly superior to most typical home routers.  The Raspberry Pi 4 makes a perfect rock solid fast home router as (unlike previous versions of the Pi) it has a gigabit ethernet port and two full speed USB3 ports integrated into this Broadcom BCM2711 device; with a very capable quad core Cortex-A72 ARM v8 driving the whole set up.  For 40 bucks US I bought the 2GB RAM model (here in New Zealand) which I've found is plenty for router purposes and is way more RAM than your typical off-the-shelf home router.

**Problem.**  Following Vlad's guide is fairly straight-forward if you plan on doing it just the one time, setting and forgetting.  However, if you at some point later want to extend the capability of the router by installing or upgrading the occasional OpenWRT package you will likely run into software incompatibility trouble as the Pi 4 version of OpenWRT is still under active development so has not moved to "stable" yet and thus you need to start from scratch following Vlad's guide and using the latest snapshot build from OpenWRT.  While that is very doable, it is not very convenient and one might spend at least an hour or so rebuilding the router installation with the latest snapshot build.

**Solution.**  Make a custom build from the latest snapshot!  Being the nice guy that I am I will be creating an updated custom build on a weekly basis using the official OpenWRT image builder system, which uses all the official OpenWRT software for the build.  I will aim to create a build each week and upload it here around the middle of each week.

# Aims of this Customised Build
The *"List of Packages"* section at the end of this readme come preinstalled on my custom build and aim to do the following "out of the box":

1. Render the new router as immediately accessible via wifi network SSID *"Rivendell"* and password *Hobbiton* to enable easy further setting up for individual use cases.
2. Enable the Pi 4 gigabit ethernet port as "Lan" on *eth0* for networking the devices on the local network.  The intention being that this port is to be connected to your home switch/wifiAP
3. Enable "plug and play" functionality for a USB3 ethernet adapter via preinstalled drivers for a range of adapters with typical various chipsets.  The default setting for a plugged adapter has been configured as *eth1* so that one of the USB3 ports of the Pi 4 can be used to connect to the ethernet port of the ISP modem/gateway for internet "Wan" connection.
4. Provide as preinstalled common router system enhancements including:
    1. USB storage plug and play functionality
    2. Router statistics module for monitoring the Pi 4 CPU temperature and other device loads.
    3. Bash instead of Ash for terminal access to the router (Ash does not keep a history of previous commands accessed through up-arrow key whereas Bash does do that)

# How-to
## System Minimum Requirements
 *  Raspberry Pi 4 with min 2GB RAM
 *  Raspberry Pi 4 enclosure/case recommended
 *  USB C cable
 *  USB power supply
 *  4GB micro SD card (2x cards is useful as you can write an updated build to one while the other is still running in the Pi)
 *  Ethernet cable
 *  USB3 ethernet adapter.  Make sure you select one that is USB3 (*not* USB2) and has OpenWRT drivers for its chipset.  Packages preinstalled in my custom build include all available OpenWRT drivers for a range of chipsets; I use a Realtek device of rtl8152 chipset that uses the kmod-usb-net-rtl8152 driver.
 *  A working laptop/desktop with wifi and SD slot (if no SD slot, use a USB sd card reader instead)
 *  micro SD to SD adapter card so that the micro can be inserted into the laptop/desktop/reader

## Linux Steps
1. Download the latest custom build from this repository
2. Insert the micro SD card into the card slot of the laptop or USB reader
3. At Linux command prompt run lsblk which will show the device name of the SD.  In my case it is /dev/mmcblk0 but if yours is different make sure to change it to what you've got when doing step 4.
4. Run dd image writer at command prompt..... dd if=openwrt-bcm27xx-bcm2711-rpi-4-[*complete the file name here*].img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M; sync .  This will write a 3GB root partition on the SD which should be plenty for any usage case but you can up-size that to take up the whole card if you like using GParted or command line tools.
5. Plug in your USB ethernet adapter to one of the the Pi's blue USB ports and connect your Pi 4 to your ISP's modem/gateway port.  Insert the micro SD card into the Pi 4 and power it up.
6. On your laptop/desktop go into network setting selection gui and connect to the new wifi network *"Rivendell"*.  Enter the password *Hobbiton*. 
7.  You should now be connected to the Pi 4.
8.  Carry out initial internet check, do the following at a Linux terminal prompt.
    1. SSH into the router by doing *ssh root@192.168.1.1*
    2. Set your router password , type *passwd* and hit enter, then enter the password you want to use twice.
    3. Ensure you have internet connection on the Pi, do *ping google.com* at the command prompt which should show very low % packet loss if any if internet is available.  If you don't get connection to google.com you should check out the connection settings for the Pi and change them to suit your ISP's modem requirements - do *nano /etc/config/network* and edit the sections of that file *"config interface 'wan' "* and *"config device 'wan_eth1_dev' "*, then do *reboot* and then SSH in again and recheck the google.com ping. 
9.  Fire up a web browser and in the address bar enter 192.168.1.1 and hit enter; you may have to accept security warnings of the browser to continue.  You should now have access to  the OpenWRT Luci web interface of your new Pi 4 router.  If you get a browser "cannot connect to host" or similar message follow step 10.  If you successfully accessed Luci you can skip that step.
10.  Luci may need to be reinstalled to access it, which I have to do after every (rare) reboot of the Pi; do the following.
     1. SSH into the Pi and do at the command prompt *opkg update; opkg --autoremove remove luci-ssl-nginx; opkg install luci-ssl-nginx*.
     2. Do not reboot, just leave the Pi running and recheck web browser access to Luci, it should be working now.
11.  Test

## Windows 10 steps
The general principles of *"Linux Steps"* above also apply to working with Windows and all steps in that section can be followed except items 3 and 4 for writing the image to the micro SD.  Please download [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ "Win32 Disk Imager") to do the image writing, and the free [Paragon Partition Manager](https://www.paragon-software.com/free/pm-express/# "Paragon Partition Manager") can be used to expand the rootfs partition to take up the whole micro SD card if that is wanted.

## Mac Steps
The *"Linux Steps"* above can be followed when working with a Mac and all steps in that section can be followed except items 3 and 4 for writing the image to the micro SD.  Please follow these following points regarding steps 3 and 4 of the process.
 * For step 3 at the Mac terminal command prompt the command *diskutil list* is used to list the device name of the SD.  In my case it is /dev/mmcblk0 but if yours is different make sure to change it to what you've got when doing step 4.
 * Step 4 above for dd image writing to micro SD is the same in Mac as it is in Linux.  I couldn't find any native app for resizing the ext4 rootfs partition to take the full card if you want to do that, but you can do this task by booting the GParted live USB - [GParted Live USB](https://gparted.org/liveusb.php "GParted Live USB").

# Further Tips
Add samba user and password (luckybastard already set up as linux user in users file /etc/passwd) do....
smbpasswd -a luckybastard

To discover what connected devices are present on the network do one or the other:
arp-scan --localnet
netdiscover -i eth0
